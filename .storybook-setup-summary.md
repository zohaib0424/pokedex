# Storybook Configuration Summary

## Fixed Issues

### 1. Import Path Resolution
**Problem**: Story files were using path aliases (e.g., `'components'`) that Storybook couldn't resolve, causing dynamic import failures.

**Solution**: Updated all story files to use relative imports instead of path aliases.

### 2. Updated Story Files

#### Common Components (Components/Common/*)
All common components now have properly configured story files with relative imports:

1. **Button** (`src/stories/Button/Button.stories.tsx`)
   - Title: "Components/Common/Button"
   - Import: `../../components/common/Button`
   - Stories: Primary, Secondary, Disabled, DisabledSecondary, WithCustomClass, WithTestId, LongText, AllVariations, SideBySide

2. **Input** (`src/stories/Input/Input.stories.tsx`)
   - Title: "Components/Common/Input"
   - Import: `../../components/common/Input`
   - Stories: Default, WithValue, WithCustomPlaceholder, WithCustomClass, WithTestId, AllVariations

3. **Tabs** (`src/stories/Tabs/Tabs.stories.tsx`)
   - Title: "Components/Common/Tabs"
   - Import: `../../components/common/Tabs`
   - Stories: Default, WithDefaultTab, CustomColors, TwoTabs, ManyTabs, Controlled, PokemonTypes, ElectricType, FireType, WaterType

4. **TypeBadge** (`src/stories/TypeBadge/TypeBadge.stories.tsx`) [NEWLY CREATED]
   - Title: "Components/Common/TypeBadge"
   - Import: `../../components/common/TypeBadge`
   - Stories: Individual stories for all 18 Pokemon types + AllTypes, PopularTypes, DualTypes

#### Feature Components (Feature/*)
1. **Loading** (`src/stories/Loading/Loading.stories.tsx`)
   - Title: "Feature/Loading"
   - Import: `../../components/feature/Loading`
   - Stories: Default, WithBackButton

## Key Changes Made

1. ✅ Fixed dynamic import errors by using relative paths
2. ✅ Standardized title hierarchy (Components/Common/* for common components)
3. ✅ Created missing TypeBadge story file
4. ✅ All story files now use consistent import patterns
5. ✅ Zero linter errors

## Next Steps

1. Restart your Storybook server: `npm run storybook`
2. All stories should now load without dynamic import errors
3. Browse components in Storybook under:
   - Components/Common/* (Button, Input, Tabs, TypeBadge)
   - Feature/* (Loading)
